Predictive Analysis-SAS
The prices of new cars in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs
incurred by the Government in the form of taxes. So, customers buying a new car can be
assured of the money they invest to be worthy. But due to the increased price of new cars and
the incapability of customers to buy new cars due to the lack of funds, used cars sales are on a
global increase (Pal, Arora and Palakurthy, 2018). There is a need for a used car price
prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety of features.
Even though there are websites that offer this service, their prediction method may not be the
best. Besides, different models and systems may contribute to predicting power for a used car’s
actual market value. It is important to know their actual market value while both buying and
selling. Therefore, to determine the appropriate value(price) we have used the craigslist's
vehicle dataset. The dataset set contains car values from 1900s to 2021. This dataset was
cleaned, pre-processed, and several predictive models were runned out of which polynomial
regression was found to be the best one with a 69.98% R2 score.
